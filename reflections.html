  <h5>Tutorial 1</h5>
  <p>The website inspiration I picked was Kowtow. I love the simplicity and organic feel of this website. 
    I started off by inserting my logo at the top middle. 
    I then began with creating a navigation bar. I had to do some research to refresh my memeory on how to create a navigation bar. I read through W3School which showed me many different navigation bar styles. I was able to use the exmaple code and implment it onto my code and adjus,t it for my website.

<h5>Tutorial 2</h5>
<p> wanted to add a photo to my basic website. I found a few photos on pintrist and added it to my code. Throughout the beginning of creating this basic website, I found positioning the hardest. I read through W3School about margins, poisitioning and paddings but I was still confused when using it in my code. 
  I had to play around with numbers to get the positioning right. 
  I added the photos onto my website and positioned it where I liked it. I then wanted to push myself and create somewhat of a slideshow. I wanted to add a button change photos. I was able to find an exmaple of this online, which I then put into my code. I again had to play around with the positioning to make sure it fit right. .</p>

  <h5>Tutorial 3</h5>
  <p >In this class, we started creating our blogs. I began with browsing through pintrest for some inspiration. I wanted to get a feel of what sort of layout and colour pallette I want to use. 
    I then began with doing a quick wireframe so I had this to look back on and it would make coding a lot easier once I had my layout complete. 
    During this class I was able to code my navigation bar, as I coded one last week. 
    I had a few issues with GitHub. I was very familiar with GitHub, but it's been a while and I've forgotten a few things and couldn't figure out how to commit my files to my repo. Im going to have do some researching and try remind myself how to use git hub again.

  <h5>Tutorial 4</h5>
  <p >During this week, I added a photo of myself and a small bio. I'm still struggling with positioning but I'm slowly figuring it out and making it work. 
    I created a couple boxes which has the words Week 1 - Week 12. I will create these boxes into buttons, which will then link you to my reflections page. Since all the reflections will be on one html page, I want to see if I can somehow make the box link to the html reflections page, whilst also linking it a section of the page. 
    I've positioned my boxes nicely, but I'm also worried about what it will look like on a bigger or smaller screen.

    <h5>Tutorial 5</h5>
    <p >During this tutorial, we learnt about @media and flexbox. This is what will change the websites layout depending on the screen size. This is definitely what I need to add to my blog. At the end of the lesson, I was still confused on how to use it. But I'm going to play around with it on my blog and hopefully I'll be able to understand it more. 
      I made the week boxes into buttons which links onto the reflections html page. I worked a little on the reflection page. I used the same navigation bar as the home page and I added photos and text to first weeks reflections - making sure itâ€™s the same layout as my wireframes. 
      There is a lot of learning going on and I feel very lost.
      I also had a read through of assignment 1. It seems pretty straight forward. I think II'm going to start with researching and having a look at some precedents and inspiration.  </p>
