        <br>
        <br>
        <p>For the first excerise, the website inspiration I picked was Kowtow. I love the simplicity and organic feel of this website.
            <br> I started off by inserting my logo at the top middle.
            <br> I then began with creating a navigation bar. I had to do some research to refresh my memeory on how to create a navigation bar. I read through W3School which showed me many different navigation bar styles.
            <br> I was able to use the example code and implment it onto my code and adjust it for my website.

        <br>
        <br>
        <p> I wanted to add a photo to my basic website. I found a few photos on Pinterest and added it to my code.
            <br> Throughout the beginning of creating this basic website, I found positioning the hardest. I read through W3School about margins, poisitioning and paddings but I was still confused when using it in my code.
            <br> I had to play around with numbers to get the positioning right. I added the photos onto my website and positioned it where I liked it. I then wanted to push myself and create somewhat of a slideshow. I wanted to add a button to change
            the photos. I was able to find an exmaple of this online, which I then put into my code. I again had to play around with the positioning to make sure it fit right. .</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>In this class, we started creating our blogs. I began with browsing through pintrest for some inspiration. I wanted to get a feel of what sort of layout and colour pallette I want to use. I then began with doing a quick wireframe so I had this
            to look back on and it would make coding a lot easier once I had my layout complete. During this class I was able to code my navigation bar, as I coded one last week. I had a few issues with GitHub. I was very familiar with GitHub, but it's
            been a while and I've forgotten a few things and couldn't figure out how to commit my files to my repo. Im going to have do some researching and try remind myself how to use git hub again.

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>During this week, I added a photo of myself and a small bio. I'm still struggling with positioning but I'm slowly figuring it out and making it work. I created a couple boxes which has the words Week 1 - Week 12. I will create these boxes into
            buttons, which will then link you to my reflections page. Since all the reflections will be on one html page, I want to see if I can somehow make the box link to the html reflections page, whilst also linking it a section of the page. I've
            positioned my boxes nicely, but I'm also worried about what it will look like on a bigger or smaller screen.

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>During this tutorial, we learnt about @media and flexbox. This is what will change the websites layout depending on the screen size. This is definitely what I need to add to my blog. At the end of the lesson, I was still confused on how to use
            it. But I'm going to play around with it on my blog and hopefully I'll be able to understand it more. I made the week boxes into buttons which links onto the reflections html page. I worked a little on the reflection page. I used the same
            navigation bar as the home page and I added photos and text to first weeks reflections - making sure itâ€™s the same layout as my wireframes. There is a lot of learning going on and I feel very lost. I also had a read through of assignment 1.
            It seems pretty straight forward. I think II'm going to start with researching and having a look at some precedents and inspiration. </p>

        <p>During this tutorial, I worked on finishing the flex box assignment that was given out in class. I was able to complete this, along with a wireframe for a phone and tablet view. This assignment made me understand flex box and @media a lot more.
            I was able to use this on my blog assignment and it made the layout so much easier for me. When the screen size changes, the layout changes exactly how I want it to. The week boxes go under each other when the screen is small (phone size).
            I also used this in my relfections page. It's made it so much easier, as im able to copy and paste a lot of my code and alter it depending on how many photos or text I want. Now that I've gotten the basic layout of my blog website, Im going
            to need to put a pause to working on this as I need to start focusing on assignment 1.

            what I found: During the rest of class, we worked on assignment 1. I started off with creating a mood board and looking at some flight website precedents

            <br> Today I also worked on my assignment 1. I have almost finished design 1. This design is more photo based. I really like this design and got a lot of inspiration from flight centre. I need to do more brainstorming for design 2 as i currenly
            don't have one in mind. Since i like this design, I need to figure out a way to create another design that is different but also a design im happy with. I think I'm going to need to do more research for precedents on websites that are more
            different.

        <p> During this tutorial 9 we went through JavaScript. The exercise for this class was pretty easy to understand.
            <Br> I created my own version of the lighbulb and instead replaced it with an empty and full glass of beer.
            <br> For tutorial 10 we had to do the dark mode exercise. I was able to read through the dark mode articles on CSS-Tricks website.
            <br> From there I found it simple and straight forward to complete. I also think this would be a great effect to use on my blog to add extra interaction.
            <br> I also worked further on assignment 1. I finished the wireframes for design 1 and I have started wireframing design 2. This is what I have so far: The home page looks somewhat cleaner and less crowded than design 1. I really like the
            booking system for design 2 as at the top, it gives you prices of dates nearby, allowing the customer to easily see if there is a flight that is cheaper.
            <br> The explore page is also more structured and cleaner than design 1 which I really liked. The destinations are split into categories (top destinations, holiday destinations and cheap deals)

            Before class I worked on my blog. I was trying to commit it but it wouldnâ€™t let me for some reason and I wasn't able to fix it. So I just created a new repo and added my latest code. I will be using this to commit my furture updated. My code has commited
            but for some reason my flex box isnt working but the code works correctly when I open it from my desktop file. During clas I meet my group. We tossed between two ideas. <br> My idea which was a website similar to Pinterest but
            for University students work.
            <br> Madisyn's idea was a website for people to find small resturants for and enable them to get exposure.
            <br> As a group, we decided to go with Madisyn's idea which i also really liked.
            <br> We are now making user stories, we got assigned two. I got Environmentally Friendly Business and Charitable People.
            <br> We are now also creating wire frames and we have split the job as we need to create user stories/needs and user flows. I have been assigned to create the user flows with Jamie.

            <br> After class, I worked on my blog. I added a zoom hover effect on all the week boxes. I also updated my reflections and added images to the slide show.
            <br> I also figured out how to add a video to my slide show. I thought this would be a great way to show my blog website progress instead of just adding photos like what I've done in my previous blog post.

        <p>
            During the pass 2 tutorials, we as a group have been working on developing our website. With everyone's busy schedule, its been hard to get the entire group together in person and with constant changes and tweaking, it has made it somewhat frustrating
            for everyone.
            <br> But we are all very happy with our concept and communicating well on discord. My main focus is working on the homepage and designing it. We have removed a couple pages to make our website more simple and minimal.
            <br> Even though we have assigned each person with a page, we all still work together and get everyones opinons to ensure that we're all happy with the design.
            <br> I have been neglecting my blog a bit so it is something I need to revisit and continue designing and coding.

            During class, as a group we discussed our website and set up questions for user testing.
            <br> I tested my friend and the photo to the left is what her response was. I definitely agree with her opinions and suggestions and it's elements that we know that we need to change.

            Today was critiques for our prototypes.
            <br> We got good feed back and it was great to get other students and Blaine's opinion and suggestions for our website. Also great to have a fresh pair of eyes look at the website.
            <br> As a group, we went through all the feedback and made a list so we could take it on board and make some changes to our website.
            <br> During the rest of the week, I started making the mobile prototype. .

            I started to work on my blog again. I added a side contents bar on the reflections page so that the user to get to any tutorial entry easier. I'm not too happy with the layout so I'm going to playing around and trying to get some more inspiration.
            <br> I've decided to make the slideshow and tutorial entry next to each other instead of under each other.
            <br> It looks a lot cleaner but also still empty with too much white space. So I've changed the colour of the navigation bar and the headers of each blog entry. It already looks a lot better.
            <br> I'm not too happy with the side contents bar as thatâ€™s what I need to work on and improve the design of. For assignment 3, we're just touching up on our prototypes and I am still working on the mobile wire frames.

            During class we as a group continued on our project. We went through the hand in requirement and split the jobs between us 5.
            <br> I am finishing the mobile prototype and wire frames.
            <br> I finished the mobile prototype and also the wire frames. The wire frames were quick and easy to do since I already finished the mobile prototype. I had to ensure that when viewing the mobile prototype that it was iPhone 8 view or lower
            as if the iPhone model is higher, it get cuts out by the camera.
            <br> Towards the end of the class, as a group we started looking at different colours as the yellow was not that great to use when white text was on top of it.

            I started to work on the contents bar on my reflections page again. I originally had just a list tutorials on the side, but I didn't like how it looked as it looked too crowded and messy.
            <br> So I decided to have the contents bar pop out on the side. When you hover over a rectangles on the side and it slides out.
            <br> I liked how it turned out. When you hover over the rectangles, it will slide out and reveal "week 1 - week 11" and if you click on it, it will bring you to the first blog post for that week.
            <br> I have also changed my navigation bar so if the user is viewing it on a smaller screen, the navigation bar will turn into a burger navigation bar. If you click onto the burger, the navigation bar will slide out.
            <br> It all works on my homepage, but on my reflections page, the navigation bars pops out under the slideshow. I need to figure out how to fix this.
            <br> I am also still trying to figure out why my website looks different (eg: font is smaller) when I publish it on GitHub. It also looks different on Google Chrome vs Safari.

        <p>
            I have just been touching up on my blog and fixing the layout. I have also been working on my Figma Prototype and adding comments to it as I have changed my design slightly.
            <br> I also briefly started working on my Group Project website. I started doing the nominations page. I did some research and was able to figure out how to make a form.
            <br> I am really happy with how my blog turned out. It definitely is the style I was going for, which was simple and clean. It has changed slightly from my first Figma Wireframe (tutorial 3).
            <br> The only problem I had was on the reflections page. When the navigation bar pops out on a mobile screen, it appears behind the first slide show. I have been trying to fix this problem but unfortunately I wasn't able to.
            <br> I learnt a lot whilst creating my blog and I definitely pushed my ideas along the way - created slideshows instead of just placing my images, contents bar hover effect, burger navigation bar on smaller screen and dark mode.
