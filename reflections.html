    <h5> Tutorial 1<br> 14th July 2020 </h5>
    <p>The website inspiration I picked was Kowtow. I love the simplicity and organic feel of this website.
      I started off by inserting my logo at the top middle.
      I then began with creating a navigation bar. I had to do some research to refresh my memeory on how to create a
      navigation bar. I read through W3School which showed me many different navigation bar styles. I was able to use
      the exmaple code and implment it onto my code and adjus,t it for my website.

    <h5>Tutorial 2</h5>
    <p> wanted to add a photo to my basic website. I found a few photos on pintrist and added it to my code. Throughout
      the beginning of creating this basic website, I found positioning the hardest. I read through W3School about
      margins, poisitioning and paddings but I was still confused when using it in my code.
      I had to play around with numbers to get the positioning right.
      I added the photos onto my website and positioned it where I liked it. I then wanted to push myself and create
      somewhat of a slideshow. I wanted to add a button change photos. I was able to find an exmaple of this online,
      which I then put into my code. I again had to play around with the positioning to make sure it fit right. .</p>

    <p>In this class, we started creating our blogs. I began with browsing through pintrest for some inspiration. I
      wanted to get a feel of what sort of layout and colour pallette I want to use.
      I then began with doing a quick wireframe so I had this to look back on and it would make coding a lot easier once
      I had my layout complete.
      During this class I was able to code my navigation bar, as I coded one last week.
      I had a few issues with GitHub. I was very familiar with GitHub, but it's been a while and I've forgotten a few
      things and couldn't figure out how to commit my files to my repo. Im going to have do some researching and try
      remind myself how to use git hub again.

    <p>During this week, I added a photo of myself and a small bio. I'm still struggling with positioning but I'm slowly
      figuring it out and making it work.
      I created a couple boxes which has the words Week 1 - Week 12. I will create these boxes into buttons, which will
      then link you to my reflections page. Since all the reflections will be on one html page, I want to see if I can
      somehow make the box link to the html reflections page, whilst also linking it a section of the page.
      I've positioned my boxes nicely, but I'm also worried about what it will look like on a bigger or smaller screen.

    <h5>Tutorial 5</h5>
    <p>During this tutorial, we learnt about @media and flexbox. This is what will change the websites layout depending
      on the screen size. This is definitely what I need to add to my blog. At the end of the lesson, I was still
      confused on how to use it. But I'm going to play around with it on my blog and hopefully I'll be able to
      understand it more.
      I made the week boxes into buttons which links onto the reflections html page. I worked a little on the reflection
      page. I used the same navigation bar as the home page and I added photos and text to first weeks reflections -
      making sure it’s the same layout as my wireframes.
      There is a lot of learning going on and I feel very lost.
      I also had a read through of assignment 1. It seems pretty straight forward. I think II'm going to start with
      researching and having a look at some precedents and inspiration. </p>

    <h5>Tutorial 6</h5>
    <p>During this tutorial, I worked on finishing the flex box assignment that was given out in class. I was able to
      complete this, along with a wireframe for a phone and tablet view. This assignment made me understand flex box and
      @media a lot more. I was able to use this on my blog assignment and it made the layout so much easier for me. When
      the screen size changes, the layout changes exactly how I want it to. The week boxes go under each other when the
      screen is small (phone size). I also used this in my relfections page. It's made it so much easier, as im able to
      copy and paste a lot of my code and alter it depending on how many photos or text I want.
      Now that I've gotten the basic layout of my blog website, Im going to need to put a pause to working on this as I
      need to start focusing on assignment 1.

      This is what I found:

      This design is more photo based. I really like this design and got a lot of inspiration from flight centre.
      I need to do more brainstorming for design 2 as i currenly don't have one in mind.
      Since i like this design, I need to figure out a way to create another design that is different but also a design
      im happy with.
      I think I'm going to need to do more research for precedents on websites that are more different.

    <p> I worked further on assignment 1. I finished the wireframes for design 1 and I have started wireframing design
      2. This is what I have so far:
      The home page looks somewhat cleaner and less crowded than design 1.
      I really like the booking system for design 2 as at the top, it gives you prices of dates nearby, allowing the
      customer to easily see if there is a flight that is cheaper.
      The explore page is also more structured and cleaner than design 1 which I really liked. The destinations are
      split into categories (top destinations, holiday destinations and cheap deals)
      <br>
      For the rest of the week, I'm going to try catch up on all the class exercises as I feel very behind because im
      trying to get assignment 1 complete as much as possible.
      I also worked on my blog. I have written a few more blog post but I need to gather photos to add to my website.

    Before class I worked on my blog. I was trying to commit it but it wouldn’t let me for some reason and I wasn't able
    to fix it. So I just created a new repo and added my latest code. I will be using this to commit my furture updated.
    My code has commited but for some reason my flex box isnt working but the code works correctly when I open it from
    my desktop file.

    During clas I meet my group. We tossed between two ideas. <br>
    My idea which was a website similar to Pinterest but for University students work.
    <br> Madisyn's idea was a website for people to find small resturants for and enable them to get exposure.
    <br> As a group, we decided to go with Madisyn's idea which i also really liked.
    <br>
    We are now making user stories, we got assigned two. I got Environmentally Friendly Business and Charitable People.
    <br>
    We are now also creating wire frames and we have split the job as we need to create user stories/needs and user
    flows. I have been assigned to create the user flows with Jamie.

      For assignment 3, our group has split website pages for each person to design. We created a mood board so we all
      know what sort of aesthetics we want our website to be.
      <br>I got assigned the index and search/filer page. I also did my own research to look for inspiration.
      <br> After class, I worked on my blog.
      I added a zoom hover effect on all the week boxes. I also updated my reflections and added images to the slide
      show.
      <br>
      I also figured out how to add a video to my slide show. I thought this would be a great way to show my blog
      website
      progress instead of just adding photos like what I've done in my previous blog post.

      During the pass 2 tutorials, we as a group have been working on developing our website. 
With everyone's busy schedule, its been hard to get the entire group together in person and with constant changes and tweaking, it has made it somewhat frustrating for everyone. 
<br> But we are all very happy with our concept and communicating well on discord. 
My main focus is working on the homepage and designing it. We have removed a couple pages to make our website more simple and minimal. 
<br> Even though we have assigned each person with a page, we all still work together and get everyones opinons to ensure that we're all happy with the design.
<br>
I have been neglecting my blog a bit so it is something I need to revisit and continue designing and coding.
