  <p>The website inspiration I picked was Kowtow. I love the simplicity and organic feel of this website. 
    I started off by inserting my logo at the top middle. 
    I then began with creating a navigation bar. I had to do some research to refresh my memeory on how to create a navigation bar. I read through W3School which showed me many different navigation bar styles. I was able to use the exmaple code and implment it onto my code and adjus,t it for my website.

<h5>Tutorial 2</h5>
<p> wanted to add a photo to my basic website. I found a few photos on pintrist and added it to my code. Throughout the beginning of creating this basic website, I found positioning the hardest. I read through W3School about margins, poisitioning and paddings but I was still confused when using it in my code. 
  I had to play around with numbers to get the positioning right. 
  I added the photos onto my website and positioned it where I liked it. I then wanted to push myself and create somewhat of a slideshow. I wanted to add a button change photos. I was able to find an exmaple of this online, which I then put into my code. I again had to play around with the positioning to make sure it fit right. .</p>
