        <h3>Tutorial 22 <br> 8th October 2020</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            I have just been touching up on my blog and fixing the layout. I have also been working on my Figma Prototype.
            <br> I briefly started working on my Group Project website. I started doing the nominations page. I did some research and was able to figure out how to make a form.
            <br> I am really happy with how my blog turned out. It defiantly is the style I was going for, which was simple and clean. It has changed a lot from my first Figma Wireframe (tutorial 3).
            <br> I definitely pushed my ideas along the way. Eg (Created slideshows instead of just placing my image, contents bar, burger navigation bar on smaller screen)
