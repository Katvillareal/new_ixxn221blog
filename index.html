            <p>Hi, I am Katrina and I am currently a Design student at Victoria University. I am studying a Bachelor of Design Innovation, majoring in Media Design.
                <br>This is my last year and throughout my 4 years of study at Victoria Univeristy, I have experience in the following :
                <br><br> - Photography
                <br>- 3D Modelling
                <br>- 3D Printing
                <br>- Creative Coding
                <br>- Website Coding
                <br>- Graphics Design
                <br>- Illustration
                <br>- UX Design
                <br>- Wearable Technology
                <br> <br> I picked this course as I enjoy coding but i enjoy designing more.
                <br> Although I have done creative coding for all three years, I do prefer website coding/designing so I took this course to learn more and expand my knowledge.

        <h3>Tutorial 22 <br> 8th October 2020</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            I have just been touching up on my blog and fixing the layout. I have also been working on my Figma Prototype and adding comments to it as I have changed my design slightly.
            <br> I also briefly started working on my Group Project website. I started doing the nominations page. I did some research and was able to figure out how to make a form.
            <br> I am really happy with how my blog turned out. It definitely is the style I was going for, which was simple and clean. It has changed slightly from my first Figma Wireframe (tutorial 3).
            <br> The only problems I had was on the reflections page. When the navigation bar pops out on a mobile screen, it appears behind the first slide show. Also, once I have published my website to GitHub and open the URL, the layout is different.
            <br> I have been trying to fix these problems but unfortunately I wasn't able to.
            <br> I learnt a lot whilst creating my blog and I definitely pushed my ideas along the way - created slideshows instead of just placing my images, contents bar hover effect, burger navigation bar on smaller screen and dark mode.
